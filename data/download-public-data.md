**description**: single-cell RNA-seq data from 45,000 immune cells from eight breast carcinomas, as well as matched normal breast tissue, blood, and lymph node.Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on eight donors using the InDrop v2 protocol. For each donor populations of CD45+ immune cells were assayed for trancriptome-wide RNA-sequence. At least one replicate was taken for each donor.<br>
**sample size**: 173 transcriptomic paired-end samples
